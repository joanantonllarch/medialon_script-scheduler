# medialon_script-scheduler
A weekly scheduler with even days and until ten different events by day with minute precision

Seven days and until ten different events by day with minute precision. Easy to upgrade to more days and/or events. Each event launch its own selected task.
To setup there is only one function with parameters. All data is saved as a json string in a persistent variable to be selected in the script configuration. Also is configurable the timing interval.

I've upload also the manager file, v6.7.2, I used to test it as example.
In this test file all events start the same task that insert the event parameters in a screen list.
